											<h2>What to expect</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Maps are ubiquitous. At their core, they are a fantastic way to visualize spatial data, and to find the patterns hidden within them. 
										As such, cartography is a valuable tool for a wide area of complex problems, 
										from disaster mitigation to start-up planning, and from public policy to wildlife conservation.
										Intimately related to this area is geographical information systems (GIS), 
										which is the collection of augmented and computerized cartography tools. </p>
										<p> Aware of and fascinated by all this, I decided in May of 2023 to do as many GIS-related projects as I 
										could as part of UCU’s <i>Geographical Information Systems</i> course. 
										Excited by the results, I now proudly present to you my projects!</p>

										<b>Description:</b> For this map I used QGIS to construct a choropleth map using data collected for the UN’s sustainable development goals. 
										In my case, I decided to map indicator 6.4.2, which concerns water stress. 
										This map is prepared specifically for print, but as you will see below I can also make similar maps tailored for digital mediums.</p>
										</br>
										<h3><u><b>Map 2: Interactive choropleth map using ArcGIS</b></u></h3>
										
										<iframe src="https://uni-utrecht.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/media/index.html?appid=e7adf4e3fd59427b8a8c7efa30c989f4&locale=en-us" 
										width="900" height="600" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen>iFrames are not supported on this page.</iframe>
										
										<p></br>
										<b>Description:</b> Given that maps are being displayed more and more using digital mediums like this very website, it begs the question: "How can we use the digital medium to its fullest?"
										 With this project, I attempt to figure this out by embedding the map with a plethora of interactive features. 
										 Try for yourself! These features were designed to be intuitive enough to require no further instructions.
										 </br>
										 </p>
										 
										 <h3><u><b>Map 3: Experimenting with Google Earth Engine</b></u></h3>
										<iframe src="https://suheilnofal619.users.earthengine.app/view/mapveg" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
										<p></br>
										<b>Description:</b> Google Earth Engine, with its remote sensing data, is an extremely powerful and versatile program, and allows you to study areas without doing any data collection of your own. 
										It is especially good for nature-related inquiries, such as vegetation density or ground moisture level. 
										Personally, I used it to find ‘nature hotspots’ in the vicinity of Utrecht. 
										I did so by displaying the vegetation index (a measure for vegetation density), the infrared band combinations (which get redder the healthier the vegetation), 
										and by superimposing an image of the World Settlement Footprint from 2015 
										</br></p>
										
										<h3><u><b>Map 4: Creating own data collection environment</b></u></h3>
										<iframe src="https://uni-utrecht.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/basic/index.html?appid=ecc0601812664eb49fefd63a747ebae5&locale=en-us" 
										width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen>iFrames are not supported on this page.</iframe>
										<p></br>											
										<b>Description:</b> With this map, the real magic has nothing to do with the map itself.
										Contrary to the other maps displayed on this website, this map is namely based on self-collected data.
										For this process, I worked with ArcGIS’s Field Map Designer to create a data-collecting app. 
										My goal with this was to create a platform in which users could identify whether a given location was ‘runable’. 
										I used Lickert items for this, which I then clustered and averaged. 
										The result of this is the map above. 
										If you are interested in the specific questions ask, you can click on a specific cluster to see a particular example.
